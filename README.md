In order for icons to display properly, you must enable `svg.context-properties.context.enabled`
in about:config.

# Known issues

- No arrows on popup menus on versions around Firefox 100
- Directly changing uidensity through about:config requires
  a restarted browser session in order to adjust omnibox scaling.
  **This does not occur through the Customise Firefox page.**
- Most popup menus need to be reworked for Photon style.
- Download button animations need to be replaced.
- Built-in dark theme has wrong icon colours on main toolbar
- A few other minor issues (button dimensions, etc.)
